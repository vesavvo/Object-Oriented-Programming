# Lambda

<!-- https://jenkov.com/tutorials/java/lambda-expressions.html -->
[Lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) (also written as λ-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic introduced in the 1930s by [Alonso Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church) for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. It is a universal model
of computation that can be used to simulate any [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine). This means that Lambda calculus is theoretically capable of expressing all tasks accomplishable by computers (Davis, M., "Computability and Unsovability", Dover, 1982).

[Imperative programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) (like Java)
in most cases implement the abstract function concept from the Lambda calculus. In Java, a lambda expression is essentially an anonymous function that can be used as a method parameter or assigned to a functional interface.The syntax of a lambda expression is: 
```java 
(parameter list) -> body
```        
In Java lambda expression, if there is only one parameter, you can leave out the parenthesis:
```java 
parameter -> body
```        

In its simple form, a lambda could be represented as a comma-separated list of parameters, the `–>` symbol and the body. Notice that the lambda function does not have a name, therefore you are not able to call it from different places in your program code. Lambda functions are used mainly locally, i.e., called in only one place. Let's have a concrete example, where we first use anonymous class:
```java
public class AnonDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Defining an anonymous method
        Runnable r = new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Running in Runnable thread");
            }
        };

        new Thread(r).start();
        System.out.println("Running in main thread");
    }
}
```
The output is
```text
Running in Runnable thread
Running in main thread
```
In this example, we used anonymous class to implement the `Runnable` interface. Let's use lambda to do the same thing.
```java
public class LambdaDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Running in Runnable thread");
        new Thread(r).start();
        System.out.println("Running in main thread");
    }
}
```
The output is the same as in the previous example. But why we were able to make the assignment to
the variable `r`?

## Functional interface

<!-- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functional-interfaces-java/ -->
Lambda expression provides implementation of _functional interface_. An interface which has only one abstract method is called functional interface. Java provides an annotation `@FunctionalInterface`, which is used to declare an interface as functional interface. And the type of the variable `r` is `Runnable` which is one functional interface.
Let's have another example:
```java
@FunctionalInterface  // optional, it allows the compiler to ensure that there is only one abstract function  
interface Drawable {  
    public void draw();  
}  
  
public class LambdaDemo2 {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        int width = 10;  
        
        Drawable d = ()-> System.out.println("Drawing " + width);
        d.draw();  
    }  
}
```
Because functional interface has only one method, it is possible to assign a lambda expression to it—even the lambda function does not have a name. In the previous example, lambda expression does not have a name, but because functional interface has only one method, the assignment is possible—and we can call the lambda function using the name `draw`.

## Return 

In Java lambda expression, if there is only one statement, you may or may not use return keyword. You must use the return keyword when lambda expression contains multiple statements.
```java
interface Addable {  
    int add(int a,int b);  
}  
  
public class LambdaDemo3 {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Lambda expression without return keyword.  
        Addable ad1 = (a,b)->(a+b);  
        System.out.println(ad1.add(10,20));  
          
        // Lambda expression with return keyword.    
        Addable ad2 = (int a,int b) -> {  
                            return (a+b);   
                        };  
        System.out.println(ad2.add(100,200));  
    }  
}  
```
In the first case `ad1`, we used the _type inference_ to avoid specifying the types of parameters in the lambda expression. This type inference means that you don't have to explicitly specify the types of parameters in most cases. The compiler can infer the types based on the context or the functional interface to which the lambda is assigned.

Usually we try to make lambda expressions as small as possible (one line functions), but sometimes you need more complicated operations to be done in lambda. Then you need to use brackets to combine multiple statements to one lambda block.

## Lambda as a parameter to make the method more general

To use a lambda expression in a method, the method should have a parameter with a functional (single-method) interface as its type. Calling the interface's method will run the lambda expression:
```java
interface StringFunction {
  String run(String str);
}

public class LambdaDemo4 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    StringFunction exclaim = (s) -> s + "!";
    StringFunction ask = (s) -> s + "?";
    
    printFormatted("Hello", exclaim);
    printFormatted("Hello", ask);
  }
  
  public static void printFormatted(String str, StringFunction format) {
    String result = format.run(str);
    System.out.println(result);
  }
}
```
The output is
```Java
Hello!
Hello?
```

This kind of function who is able to take another function as a parameter is called a [higher-order function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function). It is an essential property of _functional programming_ that we'll discuss in the next section.

## Using predefined functional interfaces

It is not always necessary to write your own functional interface. In java, there are many predefined functional interfaces.

### Consumer

Java Collections have the [Consumer](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Consumer.html) interface that has one method `accept()` which is called in many Collection methods. This method has a generic parameter, and it does not return anything (thus the name consumer). Let's have an example:
```Java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.function.Consumer;

public class LambdaDemo5 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        numbers.add(5);
        numbers.add(9);
        numbers.add(8);
        numbers.add(1);
        Consumer<Integer> method = (n) -> System.out.println(n);
        numbers.forEach(method);
    }
}
```
Java now has a type deduction for the Generics, therefore, we are able to have a nice shortcut here:
```Java
numbers.forEach((n) -> System.out.println(n));
```

### Predicate

In scientific logic, a function that accepts an argument and, in return, generates a boolean value as an answer is known as a [predicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(mathematical_logic)). Similarly, in the Java programming language, a _predicate functional interface_ of Java is a type of function that accepts a single value or argument and does some sort of processing on it, and returns a boolean (True/False) answer. The implementation of the Predicate functional interface also encapsulates the logic of _filtering_ (a process that is used to filter stream components on the base of a provided predicate) in Java. Its syntax is:
```Java
public interface Predicate<T> {
    boolean test(T t);
}
```
Here is a demo using the Predicate functional interface:
```Java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.function.Predicate;

class LambdaDemo6 {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Geek", "G-Man", "g1", "QA", "GeeksQuiz");
    
        // declare the predicate type as string and use
        // lambda expression to create object
        Predicate<String> p = (s) -> s.startsWith("G");
     
        // Iterate through the list
        for (String st : names) {
            // call the test method
            if (p.test(st))
                System.out.println(st);
        }
    }
}
```

### Method reference

You use lambda expressions to create anonymous methods. Sometimes, however, a lambda expression does nothing but calls an existing method. In those cases, it's often clearer to refer to the existing method by name. [Method references](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html) enable you to do this; they are compact, easy-to-read lambda expressions for methods that already have a name.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class MethodReferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");

        // Example 1: Reference to a static method
        names.forEach(MethodReferenceExample::printName);

        // Example 2: Reference to an instance method of a particular object
        MethodReferenceExample example = new MethodReferenceExample();
        names.forEach(example::printWithPrefix);
    }

    public static void printName(String name) {
        System.out.println(name);
    }

    public void printWithPrefix(String name) {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a class `MethodReferenceExample` that demonstrates two types of method references.

1. **Reference to a static method**: In the first `forEach` method, we pass `MethodReferenceExample::printName` as the method reference. `printName` is a static method defined in the same class. It takes a `String` parameter and prints the name. The method reference allows us to pass the method as an argument without invoking it explicitly. It behaves similar to a lambda expression that calls the referenced method.

2. **Reference to an instance method of a particular object**: In the second `forEach` method, we pass `example::printWithPrefix` as the method reference. `printWithPrefix` is an instance method of the `MethodReferenceExample` class. It takes a `String` parameter and prints the name with a prefix. Here, we create an instance of `MethodReferenceExample` and use the instance method reference to call the method on that particular object.

Both types of method references provide a concise and readable way to refer to existing methods.
They can be used in situations where you want to pass behavior that is already implemented as a method,
without the need for additional logic in a lambda expression.

When you run the code, it will print the names from the `names` list using the method references.

Output:
```
Alice
Bob
Charlie
Name: Alice
Name: Bob
Name: Charlie
```

Java method reference offers a convenient way to refer to methods as functional interfaces, enabling you to write more expressive and modular code.

## Summary

In Java, lambdas are a powerful feature in Java that allows you to
write more concise  and functional code. Here's a breakdown of the key components and syntax of
lambda expressions in Java:

1. **Functional interfaces**: Lambdas are closely tied to functional interfaces, which are
interfaces with a single abstract method. Java provides several built-in functional interfaces
like `Runnable`, `Consumer`, `Predicate`, and `Function`.
Functional interfaces are used as the target types for lambda expressions.

2. **Lambda syntax**: The basic syntax of a lambda expression consists of three parts:
the parameter list, the arrow token `->`, and the body. The parameter list defines the parameters
passed to the lambda, the arrow token separates the parameters from the body, and the body contains
the code that gets executed when the lambda is invoked.

3. **Type inference**: Java has type inference, which means you don't have to explicitly specify
the types of parameters in most cases. The compiler can infer the types based on the context or
the functional interface to which the lambda is assigned.

4. **Method references**: In addition to lambdas, Java also supports method references,
which provide a shorthand syntax for referring to an existing method. Method references can be
used in place of lambda expressions when they simply call an existing method without any additional logic.

By using lambdas and functional interfaces, you can write more concise and expressive code. Lambdas promote a more functional programming style in Java, allowing you to pass behavior as a parameter, write more compact code, and improve readability.

Here's a simple example to demonstrate the usage of lambdas in Java:

```java
public class LambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example 1: Lambda with one parameter
        GreetingService greetingService = message -> System.out.println("Hello, " + message);
        greetingService.greet("John"); // Output: Hello, John
        
        // Example 2: Lambda with multiple parameters
        Calculator calculator = (a, b) -> a + b;
        int result = calculator.add(5, 3); // Result: 8
        
        // Example 3: Method reference
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
        names.forEach(System.out::println); // Output: Alice, Bob, Charlie
    }
}

@FunctionalInterface
interface GreetingService {
    void greet(String message);
}

@FunctionalInterface
interface Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b);
}
```

In this example, we define two functional interfaces (`GreetingService` and `Calculator`) and use lambdas to implement their abstract methods. We also demonstrate the usage of method references with the `forEach` method of the `List` interface.

Lambdas are a powerful feature that promotes more functional and concise coding styles in the language.
