# Synchronization

## An example

We would like to implement a bank account. We should be able to deposit and withdraw money, and check the saldo of the bank account. Because [floating point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) have only finite precision available (Java `double` type conforms IEEE 754 Floating-Point Standard, and has 15 digits precision). If you have deal with very large sums of money, accuracy of `double` datatype may not be enough, i.e. you are not able to represent single euros when your values are in Quadrillions. That is not acceptable when we are dealing with money.

For those cases when we need to be able to represent very large values with full precision, we have `BigInteger` package in Java. [BigInteger](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigInteger.html) is able to represent numbers in range $-2^{2^{31}}...+2^{2^{31}}$ which should enough for most of the requirements (Note: the number of stars that exist in the universe is about $10^{21}$ which fits easily to the BigInteger). Because we are dealing with money in this application, we choose to use `BigInteger` to represent our values.

Because we may want to have many independent accounts, we build the account as a class (so that the reusing of it is very simple, just create a new account object with `new`-operator):
```Java
import java.math.BigInteger;

class Account {
    private BigInteger credit;

    public Account() {
        credit = BigInteger.ZERO;       // 0 to credit
    }

    public void deposit(BigInteger amount) {
        credit = credit.add(amount);
    }

    public boolean withdraw(BigInteger amount) {
        BigInteger result = credit.subtract(amount);

        if (result.signum() == -1) {    // test whether the result is negative
            return false;
        } else {
            credit = result;
            return true;
        }
    }

    public BigInteger getSaldo() {
        return credit;
    }
}
```

Then we want to have individuals who deposit money to the bank account. Again, we want to have many of them, so we create a `Depositor` class. This class is also a worker (depositing money to an account is work), and we want that this work can be done simultaneously with other depositors. Thus, we implement `Runnable` interface here:
```Java
class Depositor implements Runnable {
    private Account account;
    private int     n;

    public Depositor(Account account, int n) {
        this.account = account;
        this.n       = n;
    }

    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
            account.deposit(BigInteger.ONE);    // we deposit 1
    }
}
```

Then in the `main` method, we create two depositor workers, william and jeff. Start their work, and then we wait for them to have completed their work using the `join` method.
```Java
public class Main {
    static final int N = 1000;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Account account = new Account();

        Thread william = new Thread(new Depositor(account, N));
        Thread jeff    = new Thread(new Depositor(account, N));

        // depositors start their work
        william.start(); jeff.start();

        // here we wait for them to be ready
        try {
            william.join(); jeff.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        }

        System.out.println("Saldo is: " + account.getSaldo());
    }
}
```
Both depositors deposit 1000 times 1€. Therefore, the saldo after the deposits should be 2000€. But when we ran the application, we will get various results:
```text
Saldo is: 1029
Saldo is: 2000
Saldo is: 2000
Saldo is: 1134
Saldo is: 2000
Saldo is: 1000
Saldo is: 1099
Saldo is: 1959
Saldo is: 2000
```
There are correct answers, but a lot of incorrect results. The output seems to be random, aren't computers deterministic machines? 

## The problem

Let's analyze what happens in the statement
```Java
credit = credit.add(amount);
```
We can model this statement as
```Java
credit = credit + amount;
```
Now we need to think a little how the computer evaluates this statement. The variable `credit` is stored in the central memory (RAM). It needs to be read from the memory to the processor (CPU) register. Then we can add the content of an another memory location, variable `amount`, to it. After we have done the addition, the result should be written back to the memory, where the variable `credit` resides.
![](images/VariableReadWrite.png)

As a matter of fact, an addition is made of three operations: 
1. Read the current value of value
2. Add another value to the current value
3. Write that new value to value
When you run that code using a single thread, there are no problems.
It will execute each part of the operation one after another.
But when you have several threads, you can start having troubles.
![](images/SynchronizationProblem.png)

Imagine this situation:
1. Thread 1 : read the value, get 3, add 1, so value = 4
2. Thread 2 : read the value, get 3, add 1, so value = 4
3. Thread 1 : write 4 to the field value and return 4
4. Thread 2 : write 4 to the field value and return 4

These situations come from what we call interleaving.
Interleaving describe the possible situations of several threads executing some statements.
Even for three operations and two threads, there is a lot of possible interleavings.
When you have more threads and more operations, it is almost impossible to enumerate the possibles interleavings.
The problem can also occurs when a thread gets preempted between instructions of the operation.

In order to fix the problem, we need to make the addition operation indivisible, i.e., when one thread starts the operation, it should be able to complete the operation before any other thread will start the same operation. This kind of operation is called as an [atomic operation](https://wiki.osdev.org/Atomic_operation).

## The solution

There are several solutions to fix this problem: 
- Semaphores
- Atomic references
- Monitors
- Condition codes
- Compare and swap
- etc.

### The Java synchronized Keyword

Synchronized blocks in Java are marked with the synchronized keyword. A synchronized block in Java is synchronized on some object. All synchronized blocks synchronized on the same object can only have one thread executing inside them at the same time. All other threads attempting to enter the synchronized block are blocked until the thread inside the synchronized block exits the block.

The synchronized keyword can be used to mark four different types of blocks:
1. Instance methods
2. Static methods
3. Code blocks inside instance methods
4. Code blocks inside static methods

These blocks are synchronized on different objects. Which type of synchronized block you need depends on the concrete situation.

### Synchronized Instance Methods

Here is a synchronized instance method:
```Java
import java.math.BigInteger;

class Account {
private BigInteger credit;

    public Account() {
        credit = BigInteger.ZERO;       // 0 to credit
    }

    public synchronized void deposit(BigInteger amount) {
        credit = credit.add(amount);
    }

    public synchronized boolean withdraw(BigInteger amount) {
        BigInteger result = credit.subtract(amount);

        if (result.signum() == -1) {    // test whether the result is negative
            return false;
        } else {
            credit = result;
            return true;
        }
    }

    public BigInteger getSaldo() {
        return credit;
    }
}
```
Notice the use of the synchronized keyword in the `deposit` method declaration. This tells Java that the method is synchronized.

A synchronized instance method in Java is synchronized on the instance (object) owning the method. Thus, each instance has its synchronized methods synchronized on a different object: the owning instance.

Only one thread per instance can execute inside a synchronized instance method. If more than one instance exist, then one thread at a time can execute inside a synchronized instance method per instance. One thread per instance.

This is true across all synchronized instance methods for the same object (instance). Thus, in the previous example, only one thread can execute inside either of of the two synchronized methods. One thread in total per instance.

Now when we run the application, the results are correct:
```text
Saldo is: 2000
Saldo is: 2000
Saldo is: 2000
Saldo is: 2000
Saldo is: 2000
Saldo is: 2000
Saldo is: 2000
Saldo is: 2000
Saldo is: 2000
```
### Synchronized Blocks in Instance Methods
You do not have to synchronize a whole method. Sometimes it is preferable to synchronize only part of a method. Java synchronized blocks inside methods makes this possible.

Here is a synchronized block of Java code inside an unsynchronized Java method:
```Java
public void deposit(BigInteger amount) {
    // here we can have unsychronized tasks
    synchronized(this) {
        credit=credit.add(amount);
    }
    // here we can have unsychronized tasks
}
```    
This example uses the Java synchronized block construct to mark a block of code as synchronized. This code will now execute as if it was a synchronized method.

Notice how the Java synchronized block construct takes an object in parentheses. In the example `this` is used, which is the instance the add method is called on. The object taken in the parentheses by the synchronized construct is called a monitor object. The code is said to be synchronized on the monitor object. A synchronized instance method uses the object it belongs to as monitor object.

Only one thread can execute inside a Java code block synchronized on the same monitor object.

## Assignments

**Task 1: Problems in concurrency**

Correct the concurrency problem in the following account example (class BankExample). Verify that the program works in wrong way before the correction and right way after it. Does your verification guarantee correctness of the program?
```Java
class BankExample {
    // TODO
}
```

**Task 2: Thread-safe**

Assuming `ArrayList` is not thread-safe, design a class that has methods for adding an element to an `ArrayList` collection, querying the size of the collection, and removing an element from the collection. The elements may be any objects of your choice, such as Strings. The class you design should be thread-safe. Design a class that you can use to test thread-safety of your class.
