# 1.3. Control structures

The control structures make it possible to control the flow of the program. These include the conditional statements and loops.

In Java, the control structures are the same as in JavaScript, which in turn are the same as in C and C++. The syntax is also the same as in C and C++.

In this subsection we review the control structures in Java. For simplicity, we use simple examples where the entire program logic is in the main method. (In the next module, we learn how to split the program logic into separate classes and methods in an object-oriented way.)

## 1.3.1. Conditional statements

The conditional statements in Java are:

* `if`
* `if-else`
* `if-else if-else`
* `switch/case`


### if

The `if` statement splits the flow of control into two alternative paths.

The following example asks the user for a number. If the number is greater than zero, the program prints the message "The number is positive".

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PositiveNumber {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Give a number:");
        int number = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is positive.");
        }
    }
}
```

The condition in the `if` statement is always a logical expression. In the example above, the condition is `number > 0`. If the condition is true, the program executes the code block that follows the `if` statement. If the condition is false, the program does not execute the code block.

A logical expression is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value (`true` or `false`). A complex logical expression can be built from simpler logical expressions using logical operators. The most common logical operators in Java are:

* `==` - equal to
* `!=` - not equal to
* `>` - greater than
* `>=` - greater than or equal to
* `<` - less than
* `<=` - less than or equal to
* `!` - logical NOT
* `&&` - logical AND
* `||` - logical OR

The order (i.e., operator [precedence](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11precedence/)) in which the operators are evaluated is the same as in Python. The comparison operators are applied first. After that, the logical NOT operator has the highest precedence, followed by the logical AND operator, and, after that, the logical OR operator. The order of evaluation can be changed by using parentheses, which have the highest precedence of all.

An example of an `if` statement with a complex condition is below:

```java
if ((number > 0 && number < 10) || number == -1) {
    System.out.println("The number is between 1 and 9, or it is -1.");
}
```

In the previous example, the inner parentheses are not necessary as the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator. However, the parentheses make the code easier to read.

### if-else

The `if-else` statement splits the flow of control into two alternative paths. The `else` statement is executed if the condition of the `if` statement is false.

In the following example, the user is asked for a number. If the number is greater than zero, the program prints the message "The number is positive". Otherwise, the program prints the message "The number is not positive".

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PositiveNumber {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Give a number:");
        int number = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is positive.");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("The number is not positive.");
        }
    }
}
``` 

In Java, the condition of the `if` statement must be a boolean value. If the condition is true, the program executes the code block that follows the `if` statement. If the condition is false, the program executes the code block that follows the `else` statement. The condition should be placed in parentheses.

### if-else if-else

The `if-else if-else` statement splits the flow of control into several alternative paths. The `else if` statement is executed if the condition of the `if` statement is false. The `else` statement is executed if all the previous conditions are false.

Continuing the previous example, the following program asks the user for a number. If the number is greater than zero, the program prints the message "The number is positive". If the number is less than zero, the program prints the message "The number is negative". Otherwise, the program prints the message "The number is zero".

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PositiveNumber {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Give a number:");
        int number = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is positive.");
        }
        else if (number < 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is negative.");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("The number is zero.");
        }
    }
}
```

In the example, there was one `else-if` statement. There can be any number of `else-if` statements. The `else` statement is optional.

### switch/case

The purpose of the `switch/case` statement is to select one of several alternatives. The `switch/case` statement is an alternative to the `if-else if-else` statement. The main difference is that the value of the variable is compared to the values of the `case` statements.

An example of the `switch/case` statement is the following program that asks the user for a number. If the number is 1, the program prints the message "The number is one". If the number is 2, the program prints the message "The number is two". Otherwise, the program prints the message "The number is neither one nor two".

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class OneOrTwo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Give a number:");
        int number = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

        switch (number) {
            case 1:
                System.out.println("The number is one.");
                break;
            case 2:
                System.out.println("The number is two.");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("The number is neither one nor two.");
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, each branch ends in a `break` statement. The `break` statement ends the execution of the `switch/case` statement. If the `break` statement is omitted, the execution continues to the next branch. If we omitted all the `break` statements, and the value of the variable `number`was 1, the program would print the following:

```plaintext
The number is one.
The number is two.
The number is neither one nor two.
```

This would make little sense. Therefore, we should always remember to add the `break` statements.

There are, however, cases where the `break` statement is deliberately omitted. The following program asks the user for a character. Then the program notifies the user if the letter is a Scandinavian letter, after which it lets the user know if the character is a vowel or not. (Note that all Scandinavian characters are vowels, too.)

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class VowelOrNot {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Give a character:");
        char character = scanner.nextLine().toLowerCase().charAt(0);

        switch (character) {
            case 'å':
            case 'ä':
            case 'ö':
                System.out.println("The character is a Scandinavian character.");
            case 'a':
            case 'e':
            case 'i':
            case 'o':
            case 'u':
                System.out.println("The character is a vowel.");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("The character is not a vowel.");
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

Let's run the program and enter letter *e* as input. The output is as follows:
    
```plaintext
Give a character:
e
The character is a vowel.
```

Next, we rerun the program and enter the Scandinavian letter *ä*:

```plaintext
Give a character:
ä
The character is a Scandinavian character.
The character is a vowel.
```

## 1.3.2. Loops

Loops make it possible to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is met.

There are four types of loops in Java: `while`, `do-while`, `for`, and `for-each`. The `while` loop is the most basic loop. The `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known. The `for-each` loop is used to iterate over the elements of an array or a collection.

In addition, there is the `for/each` loop, which is used to iterate over the elements of an array or a collection. We will discuss the `for/each` loop later, in conjunction with arrays.

### while

The `while` loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true. The `while` loop is useful when we do not know in advance how many times the block of code needs to be repeated.

The following program asks the user for a number. If the number is greater than zero, the program prints the message "The number is positive". Otherwise, the program prints the message "The number is not positive". The program repeats this until the user enters the number 0.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PositiveNumber {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Give a number:");
        int number = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());
        
        while (number != 0) {
            if (number > 0) {
                System.out.println("The number is positive.");
            }
            else if (number < 0) {
                System.out.println("The number is not positive.");
            }
            System.out.println("Give another number:");
            number = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());
        }
    }
}
```

Let's run the program and enter numbers -1, 5, and 0 as input. The output is as follows:

```plaintext
Give a number:
-1
The number is not positive.
Give another number:
5
The number is positive.
Give another number:
0
```


### do-while

The following program should behave identically to the previous program: it asks the user for a number, and prints either the text "The number is positive", or the text "The number is not positive". The program terminates when the user enters the number 0.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PositiveNumber {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int number;

        do {
            System.out.println("Give a number:");
            number = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

            if (number > 0) {
                System.out.println("The number is positive.");
            }
            else if (number < 0) {
                System.out.println("The number is not positive.");
            }
        } while (number != 0);
    }
}
```

Let's run the program and enter numbers 7, -2, and 0 as input. The output is as follows:

```plaintext
Give a number:
7
The number is positive.
Give a number:
-2
The number is not positive.
Give a number:
0
```

The difference between the `while` and `do-while` loops is that the `do-while` loop always executes the code block at least once. The `while` loop, on the other hand, does not execute the code block at all if the condition is not true.

### for

The `for` loop is used to repeat a block of code a known number of times. The `for` loop is useful when we know in advance how many times the block of code needs to be repeated.

The following program prints the numbers 1 to 10:

```java
public class FromOneToTen {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```

Technically, the `for` loop consists of three parts: the initialization, the condition, and the increment/decrement.
- The initialization is executed once when the loop starts.
- The condition is checked before each iteration. If the condition is true, the code block is executed.
- After the code block has been executed, the increment/decrement is executed, and the condition is checked again.

The following program prints the numbers 10 to 1:

```java
public class FromTenToOne {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```

The loop variable `i` is not available after the loop. If you want to utilize it after the loop, declaration of the loop variable should be in the outer block:
```java
public class FromOneToEleven {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i;
        
        for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
        System.out.println(i);
    }
}
```

## Nested control structures

Control structures can be nested inside each other. For example, we can place a `while` loop inside a `for` loop, or a `for` loop inside a `while` loop. We can also place a `for` loop inside another `for` loop, and there can be and `if-else` statement inside a `for` loop, and so on.

In the following example, we compute all the products of two integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 5. For each product, the program prints whether it is even or odd.

```java

public class NestedLoops {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= 5; j++) {
                int product = i * j;
                System.out.print(i + "*" + j + "=" + product + " ");
                if (product % 2 == 0) {
                    System.out.println("even");
                } else {
                    System.out.println("odd");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We run the program and the output is as follows:

```plaintext
1*1=1 odd
1*2=2 even
1*3=3 odd
1*4=4 even
1*5=5 odd
2*1=2 even
2*2=4 even
...
5*3=15 odd
5*4=20 even
5*5=25 odd
```

This is an example of nesting control structures. It is a common yet powerful technique that makes it possible to implement any program logic.



## Assignments:

**Task 1: Quadratic equation solver**

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the coefficients of a quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) and calculates its roots using the quadratic formula. Display the roots on the console. If the equation has no real roots, display the message "No real roots".


**Task 2: Binary values**

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a binary number (composed of 0s and 1s) and converts it to decimal. Display the decimal equivalent on the console. **Hint**: use the `charAt` method of the `String` class to retrieve the individual bits in the input string.


**Task 3: Prime number generator**

Write a program that prompts the user to enter two positive integers, start and end (where start < end). The program should generate and display all the prime numbers between start and end, inclusive.

A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Your program should use control structures (such as loops and conditional statements) to implement the logic for generating and checking prime numbers.

**Task 4: Multiplication table exam**

In primary school, students must memorize the multiplication tables for numbers 1 to 10. Create a program to assist primary school students that presents the user with ten randomly generated multiplication problems, where the factors are integers between one and ten. After each answer, the program indicates whether it was correct or not. The user receives one point for each correctly answered question. If the user scores ten points for the entire set of problems, the program congratulates them on mastering the multiplication tables and terminates. Otherwise, the program starts a new set of problems.

Hint: Random number can be generated with Math.random().

Below is a code that returns a random number between 1 and 10.
```java
int luku = (int) (Math.random() * 10) + 1;
```

For this assignment, you get points in the following way:

1. Task 1 completed: 1 point
2. Task 2 completed: 1 point
3. Task 3 completed: 2 points
4. Task 4 completed: 2 points
