# 7.3. Basics of object-Relational mapping

In the previous submodule, we learned how to use the JDBC driver to connect to a database and execute SQL queries. This approach requires the developer to embed SQL queries in the code. However, this is not a very good practice, as it makes the code less readable as well as more prone to vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks.

The root cause of the problem is the fact that the data models in Java and the database are inherently different. The database follows a relational model, whereas the Java programming language uses an object-oriented model. For instance, representing object relationships in a database may not always be straightforward. A many-to-many association, for example, will result in a link table being created in the database, whereas there is not a unified, straightforward way to express the inheritance
relationship. Moreover, there are smaller nuisances such as the different data types used in the two models.

In this submodule, we will learn how to use object-relational mapping (ORM) to map the database tables to Java objects. This will allow us to use the Java programming language to specify the database structure as well as access the database.

The idea of ORM is to avoid the need to write SQL queries in the code. Instead, we specify the relationship between the database tables and the Java objects. This object-relational mapping is then used to automatically generate the SQL queries for data storage and retrieval operations, and, if desired, for automatic generation of the database schema. This is a very powerful concept, as it adds structural simplicity in the the Java programs,
making them more readable and maintainable.

The ORM libraries usually have the functionality to both create the database tables and to access the data in the database. 

## 7.3.2 Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) and Hibernate

JPA (Jakarta Persistence API) is a programming interface developed for the Java language to implement object-relational mapping.
Similar solutions exist for other programming languages.

With JPA, the following tasks can be automated:
- establishing and managing database connections
- generating database table structures (in a code-first approach)
- storing and retrieving objects.

Storage and retrieval are implemented so that:
1. the application developer writes Java method calls for objects. Method parameters and return values are also objects.
2. The called methods generate the necessary SQL statements, which are sent to the database server.
3. Responses from the database server (such as result sets) are brought into Java data structures (as an instance of the target area class or an appropriate data structure class).

JPA is a programming interface that only defines classes and methods.
It must be technically implemented.
Implementations that provide JPA include:
- Hibernate
- EclipseLink
- Oracle TopLink
JPA implementations include implementation-specific additional functionality.
This course aims to limit itself to the functionality specified by JPA.
This promotes code portability. As a JPA implementation, we will use Hibernate which is a widely-used implementation.
See [https://hibernate.org/].

The history of JPA started in 2006, when the Java Persistence API (JPA) was introduced. However, it was not until the JPA 2.0 specification that the
JPA became widely used.
Starting from version 3.0, JPA is known as Jakarta Persistence API, prior to which it was known as Java Persistence API.

It is worth noting that Hibernate supports two different APIs: Hibernate Core and Hibernate ORM. The former is the original Hibernate API, whereas the latter is the JPA-compliant API. In this course, we will use the JPA-compliant Hibernate ORM API.

## 7.3.3. Maven dependencies

The easiest way to use Hibernate's JPA-compliant API is to specify the corresponding Maven dependencies. To do this, add the following dependencies to the pom.xml file:

```xml
 <dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.persistence</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.persistence-api</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
 </dependency>
 <dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.0.Final</version>
 </dependency>
```

Also, make sure that you include the `dependency` element for the MariaDB database driver:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mariadb.jdbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>mariadb-java-client</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.2</version>
</dependency>
```

In addition, install the dependency for a logging framework. For example, you can use the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
    <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.6</version>
</dependency>
```

You can replace the version numbers with the latest versions. However, keep in mind that the newest version of Jakarta persistence may
not yet be compatible with the newest version of Hibernate.

## 7.3.4. Project structure

The overall structure of the project may look like this:

![Project structure](images/Structure_of_project.PNG)

The JPA example contains the same four folders as our earlier non-JPA example:
- `application`. This folder contains the code for the main application.
- `dao`. This folder contains the code for accessing the database. 
- `datasource`. This folder contains the code for connecting to the database.
- `entity`. This folder contains the entity classes. The entity classes are annotated with JPA annotations.

In addition to these, there is the META-INF folder, which contains the persistence.xml file. This file contains the configuration for the JPA provider (Hibernate in our case).

The resources folder contains the configuration file for the logging framework. The default logging level is set to `DEBUG`,
which is quite verbose. You can change this to `INFO` or `ERROR` to reduce the amount of logging. For now, the `INFO` level is
sufficient.

You can change the level by modifying the `logback.xml` file in the resources folder. Replace the contents with the following:

<configuration>
<logger name="org.hibernate" level="INFO" />
</configuration>

## 7.3.5. Configuration file

The JPA configuration file is called `persistence.xml`. It is located in the META-INF folder. The file contains the information about the database connection, the JPA provider, and the entity classes. The file may look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<persistence xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence"
             xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             version="3.0"
             xsi:schemaLocation="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_0.xsd">
    <persistence-unit name="CompanyMariaDbUnit" transaction-type="RESOURCE_LOCAL">
        <provider>org.hibernate.jpa.HibernatePersistenceProvider</provider>
        <properties>
            <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.url" value="jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/company"/>
            <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.user" value="appuser"/>
            <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.password" value="password"/>
            <property name="jakarta.persistence.jdbc.driver" value="org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver"/>
            <property name="jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action" value="none"/>
            <property name="jakarta.persistence.sql-dialect" value="org.hibernate.dialect.MariaDBDialect"/>
            <property name="hibernate.show_sql" value="true" />
        </properties>

    </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
```

Each database connection is specified in a separate `persistence-unit` element. The name of the unit is later given in the code that utilizes the database connection.

The `provider` element specifies the JPA provider. In our case, it is Hibernate.

The `properties` element contains a collection of `property` elements. Each property element contains the name of the property and its value. The property names are specified in the JPA specification. The property values are specific to the JPA provider.

In our example, the following properties are specified:
- `jakarta.persistence.jdbc.url`. The URL of the database. As the value, we specify the connection string of the MariaDB database.
- `jakarta.persistence.jdbc.user`. The username for the database connection.
- `jakarta.persistence.jdbc.password`. The password for the database connection.
- `jakarta.persistence.jdbc.driver`. The driver class for the database connection. In our case, it is the MariaDB driver class.
- `jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action`. The action to be performed when the database schema is created. In our case, we specify `none`, which means that
we will be using the existing content of the database. If we chose `drop-and-create` instead, Hibernate would drop the existing tables from the database and recreate them with CREATE TABLE statements. The content of the statements would be based on the annotations in the entity classes.
- `jakarta.persistence.sql-dialect`. The SQL dialect for the database. In our case, it is the dialect for MariaDB.
- `hibernate.show_sql`. If set to `true`, Hibernate will log the SQL statements that it executes. This is useful for debugging.

## 7.3.6. Entity class

In our example we have just one entity class, the `Employee` class. To describe the relationship between the object of this class and the database table, we use JPA annotations. The `Employee` class may look like this:

```java
package entity;

import jakarta.persistence.*;

@Entity
@Table(name="employee")
public class Employee {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private int id;
    @Column(name="first_name")
    private String firstName;
    @Column(name="last_name")
    private String lastName;
    private String email;
    private double salary;

    public Employee(String firstName, String lastName, String email, double salary) {
        super();
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.email = email;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public Employee() {

    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }

    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }

    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public void setEmail(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}
```

Just on top of the definition of the class, there are two annotations:
- `@Entity`. This mandatory annotation tells JPA that this class is an entity class.
- `@Table`. This annotation tells JPA that the database table corresponding to this class is called `employee`.

The remaining annotations are place on top of the corresponding instance variables. These are:
- `@Id`. This is another of the two mandatory annotations. The annotation tells JPA that this instance variable is the primary key of the database table.
- `@GeneratedValue`. This annotation tells JPA that the primary key is generated automatically by the database. As we use MariaDB, we specify the `GenerationType.IDENTITY` strategy, which means that the primary key is generated by the database using the `AUTO_INCREMENT` feature.
- `@Column`. This annotation tells JPA that the instance variable is mapped to the database column with the given name. This is an optional placeholder annotation that is needed in order to make it possible to specify the name of the column. The column name is specified in the `name` attribute of the annotation.

Note that if we do not specify the names of the databse table and the columns, JPA will use the class name as well as
names of the instance variables as the names of the database table and the columns.

As Hibernate will by default use getters and setters to access the instance variables, we need to provide the getters and setters for the instance variables. In our example, we have the getters and setters for all the instance variables.

Also, it is necessary to provide the default constructor of the class. This is because Hibernate will use the default constructor to create new instances of the class. Whenever we have written a constructor that takes parameters, we need to explicitly write the default constructor as well.


## 7.3.7. DAO class

The main benefit of using JPA is that we do not need to write the SQL statements for the database operations. Instead, we can use the JPA API to perform the database operations. The JPA API is a set of classes and interfaces that are used to perform the database operations. The API is defined in the `jakarta.persistence` package.

In this example, we have one DAO class, the `EmployeeDAO` class. The class contains methods for carrying out each of the database operations:

```java
package dao;

import entity.*;
import jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;

public class EmployeeDao {

    public void persist(Employee emp) {
        EntityManager em = datasource.MariaDbJpaConnection.getInstance();
        em.getTransaction().begin();
        em.persist(emp);
        em.getTransaction().commit();
    }

    public Employee find(int id) {
        EntityManager em = datasource.MariaDbJpaConnection.getInstance();
        Employee emp = em.find(Employee.class, id);
        return emp;
    }

    public void update(Employee emp) {
        EntityManager em = datasource.MariaDbJpaConnection.getInstance();
        em.getTransaction().begin();
        em.merge(emp);
        em.getTransaction().commit();
    }

    public void delete(Employee emp) {
        EntityManager em = datasource.MariaDbJpaConnection.getInstance();
        em.getTransaction().begin();
        em.remove(emp);
        em.getTransaction().commit();
    }
}

```

What first strikes out, is the simplicity of each DAO method.

The methods use the `EntityManager` object to perform the operations. The `EntityManager` object is obtained by calling the `getInstance()` method of the `MariaDbJpaConnection` class.

The `EntityManager` object is in charge of creating and executing the SQL statements. Also, the `EntityManager` manages the objects. This means that it is able to keep track of the changes that are made to the objects and to persist these changes to the database.

In our example, there is one CRUD method for each of the operations.

Whenever an object is persisted in the database, the `persist` method of the `EntityManager` object is called. The `EntityManager` object then creates the SQL statement and executes it. The `EntityManager` object also keeps track of the changes that are made to the object and persists these changes to the database whenever the flush or commit method is called.

The retrieval of an object from the database is done by calling the `find` method of the `EntityManager` object. The `EntityManager` object then creates the SELECT
statement and executes it. The result of the query is returned as an object of the `Employee` class. The `find` method takes two arguments: the class of the object and the primary key value of the object. The method automatically construct the object and returns it.

When retrieving data form the database, always use the `find` method of the `EntityManager` object if possible. This is the easiest and the most recommended way of retrieving data from the database, and it provides the best performance.

Note that the methods that modify the database are wrapped in a transaction. For the data retrieval operations, the transaction is not needed, because the data is not modified. For data manipulation operations, a transaction is obtained by calling the `begin()` method of the `EntityManager` object. The transaction is committed by calling the `commit()` method of the `EntityManager` object. The purpose of the transaction is to make sure that the changes are persisted to the database only if all the operations are successful. If any of the operations fail, the transaction is rolled back and the changes are not persisted to the database. Should the rollback happen, the `EntityManager` object is in charge of restoring the state of the objects to the state they had before the transaction was started.

## 7.3.8. Connection class

The connection class is a singleton class that is used to obtain the `EntityManager` object. The class may look like this:

```java
package datasource;

import jakarta.persistence.*;

public class MariaDbJpaConnection {

    private static EntityManagerFactory emf = null;
    private static EntityManager em = null;

    public static EntityManager getInstance() {
        // you need to add synchronization if you run in a multi-threaded environment

        if (em==null) {
            if (emf==null) {
                emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("CompanyMariaDbUnit");
            }
            em = emf.createEntityManager();
        }
        return em;
    }
}
```

This class contains the `getInstance()` method that provides the `EntityManager` object. The method is a singleton method, which means that it returns the same object every time it is called. 

If we ever need to run the application in a multi-threaded environment, we need to add synchronization to the method. This is done by adding the `synchronized` keyword to the method declaration.

There are other alternatives for getting the EntityManger object besides the singleton model. It is also possible to create a new EntityManager object for each request. This is done by calling the `createEntityManager()` method of the `EntityManagerFactory` object. Both approaches have their pros and cons. The singleton approach is more efficient, but it is not thread-safe. The approach of creating a new EntityManager object for each request is thread-safe, but it is less efficient. Also, the limited scope of the `EntityManager` created within each DAO method may cause problems in some cases.

## 7.3.9. Application class

The application class is the class that contains the main method. Here is a simple example of such a class:

```java
package application;

import entity.*;
import dao.*;
public class CompanyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        EmployeeDao empdao = new EmployeeDao();

        empdao.persist(new Employee("Viivi", "Puro", "viivip@mymail.fi", 7300.00));
        empdao.persist(new Employee("Tero", "Koski", "tero.koski@mymail.fi", 3750.00));

        Employee emp = empdao.find(1);
        System.out.println(emp.getFirstName() + " " + emp.getLastName());

        emp.setLastName("Koski");
        empdao.update(emp);
    }
}

```

In the example, we create two employees and persist them to the database. Then we retrieve the first employee from the database and print the first and last name of the employee. Finally, we update the last name of the employee and persist the changes to the database.

Let's run our application. The following output is sent to the console:

```
Hibernate: insert into employee (email, first_name, last_name, salary) values (?, ?, ?, ?)
Hibernate: insert into employee (email, first_name, last_name, salary) values (?, ?, ?, ?)
Hibernate: select e1_0.id,e1_0.email,e1_0.first_name,e1_0.last_name,e1_0.salary from employee e1_0 where e1_0.id=?
John Doe
Hibernate: update employee set email=?, first_name=?, last_name=?, salary=? where id=?
```

The only real output of the application is the first and last name of the employee. The rest of the output is generated by Hibernate. The output shows that two employees are persisted to the database.

Next, a SELECT statement was generated for retrieving the first employee's data from the database. The output shows that the first name of the employee is `John` and the last name is `Doe`.

Finally, the last name of the employee is updated and the changes are persisted to the database. The output shows that the `update` statement was generated and executed.

## 7.3.9. States of an object

In our DAO methods, the `EntityManager` object takes care of each object's state. An object may have the following states:
- **New**. The object has been instantiated with the new keyword but has not yet been associated with an EntityManager.
- **Transient**. The object is associated with an EntityManager, but it has not yet been persisted to the database.
- **Managed**. The object is managed by the `EntityManager` object and it is persisted to the database. An object becomes managed when it is retrieved from the database or when it is persisted to the database by the `EntityManager` object.
- **Detached**. The object is not managed by the `EntityManager` object, but it is persisted to the database. An object becomes detached when it is no more in the scope of the `EntityManager` object.
- **Removed**. The object is not managed by the `EntityManager` object, and it has been removed from the database by the `EntityManager` object.

In out example, the following steps take place:
1. we first generate the `Employee` objects with the `new` statement. The resulting object's state is now *New*.
2. As a DAO method is called, the `EntityManager` object is obtained. The `EntityManager` object then associates the object with itself. The object's state is now *Transient*. This happens at the point where the `persist` method is called.
3. As the `commit` method is called, the `EntityManager` object persists the object to the database. The object's state is now *Managed*.

At this point, you should understand the basics of designing a working JPA application. In the next module, we extend to the situations where there are many entities and various relationships between the entities.
