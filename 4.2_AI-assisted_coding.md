# 4.2. AI-assisted coding

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant developed through a collaboration between OpenAI and GitHub.
GitHub Copilot is designed to help programmers write code more efficiently and quickly. It integrates directly into programming environments such as IntelliJ Idea and automatically suggests code snippets or functions in real time as you type. Capable of understanding your intentions through the code you write, it learns from your coding style and past solutions.

In this submodule, we install GitHub Copilot and activate in in IntelliJ Idea. Then, we explore the functionality with a few coding assignments.

## 4.2.1. Installation and activation

GitHub CoPilot requires a paid or free plan. The use of GitHub Copilot is included in the GitHub Education package, which is available to all students in Metropolia.

To sign up for GitHub Education, proceed as follows:

1. Make sure that you have your real name set in your GitHub profile. If you have not done so, click on your profile thumbnail in GitHub, then click **Settings** and **Profile**. Enter your real name in the **Name** field and click **Save**.
2. Go to https://education.github.com/pack and verify your student status.
As a consequence of the verification procedure, you should receive an approval notification by email. The following ways to prove one's identity are known to work for students in Metropolia (In verification, GitHub seems to prefer documents showed via the webcam to scanned documents):
   - the student card from the Tuudo app displayed via the webcam
   - a transcript of records from Oma
2. Log in to GitHub. Click your profile thumbnail in the upper right corner and select **Settings**.
3. Choose **Billing and Plans / Plans and usage**. Enable GitHub Copilot.
4. In the **Settings** menu click **Copilot**. Choose **Allow** under the **Suggestions matching public code** section. Also, tick **Allow GitHub to use my code snippets...** if you want to expose your own code as data for other users´ recommendations.

Next, open IntelliJ Idea.
1. Choose **File / Settings**.
2. Click **Plugins**.
3. Type **GitHub Copilot** in the search box and click **Install**. After the installation, restart your IDE if the system so prompts.
4. Go to **Tools / GitHub Copilot**, and select **Log into GitHub**. Enter your GitHub credentials when requested and log in.
5. Click **Tools  / GitHub Copilot** and select **Show completions**. If this option is already turned on, you can skip this step.
6. Click **Tools  / GitHub Copilot** and select **Show suggestions**. If this option is already turned on, you can skip this step.

Now you should be ready to use GitHub Copilot. Play with it a bit to get a feeling of how it works. Then complete the following assignments to further explore the functionality.

## Assignments

Submit the answer of this assignment as a pdf file. The file should contain the source codes of the relevant classes as well as an explanation of how you used GitHub Copilot to write the code. For each assignment, evaluate the applicability of GitHub Copilot for your own coding style. What are the benefits and drawbacks of using GitHub Copilot?

### Assignment 1: Using GitHub Copilot to write methods

In a new project, write a `Calculator` class that has the ability to sum positive integers. A negative integer should throw an exception.

The class acts as the model in the MVC pattern. It should have the following methods:
- A method that resets the calculator to zero.
- A method that adds an integer to the calculator.
- A method that returns the current value of the calculator.

In addition, write a temporary main method that creates an instance of the `Calculator` class and uses it to calculate the sum of a few integers.

Explore various way in which you can use GitHub Copilot to write the sum method. For example, try the following:

- Write the method signature and let GitHub Copilot write the method body.
- Write the method signature and the first line of the method body, and let GitHub Copilot write the rest. Then, modify the code to use a different loop structure (while instead of for, or vice versa) in the body.
- Write a comment where you describe the method in English, letting GitHub Copilot write the method body based on the comment.


### Assignment 2: Using GitHub Copilot to explain code

With GitHub Copilot, you can also write comments and explanations of code. In this assignment, you will write a textual explanation of the `Calculator` class and its methods. Use GitHub Copilot to write the explanations. Then, modify the explanations to make them more readable and understandable.

Proceed as follows:

1. Create a Markdown file in your project. Name it `README.md`. If you are not familiar with Markdown, you can read about it here: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
2. Write a short description of the idea of the document in the beginning of the file. You can edit the md document in IntelliJ Idea.
3. Copy the code of the `Calculator` class to the md file. Be sure to mark the code as code by using three backticks before and after the code block:
4. Below the code, explain how the class works. Use GitHub Copilot to write the explanation. Then, modify the explanation to make it more readable and understandable.
