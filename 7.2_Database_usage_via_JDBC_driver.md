# 7.2. Database usage via JDBC driver

In this submodule, we learn to persist information into the database and retrieve information from the database.

We use the `company` database introduced in the previous submodule as an example. So far, the database contains
just one table, the `EMPLOYEE` table.

Our goal is to provide functionality for three operations:
1. to retrieve all employees from the database
2. to retrieve an employee from the database by id
3. to persist an employee into the database

## 7.2.1. Designing the structure of the application

At this point, we design a structure for our application. We create a new Java project, and split the code into four
packages:
- `application`. This package contains the code for the main application.
- `dao`. This package contains the code for accessing the database.
- `datasource`. This package contains the code for connecting to the database.
- `entity`. This package contains the entity classes. Using MVC terms, this constitutes the model.

The following image shows the structure of the project:

![Structure of a database project](images/structure_of_project.PNG)

In each package, there can be one or more classes. In our example, there is just one class in each package.

## 7.2.2. The entity class

The entity class is a class that represents an entity in the database. In our example, the entity class is the `Employee` class. It looks like this:

```java
package entity;

public class Employee {

    private String firstName, lastName, email;
    private double salary;

    public Employee(String firstName, String lastName, String email, double salary) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.email = email;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }

    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }

    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public void setEmail(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}
```

The class contains the declarations of the instance variables, the constructor, and the getters and setters for the instance variables.

## 7.2.3. The datasource class

In our example, `MariaDbConnection` is the datasource class. It looks like this:

```java
package datasource;

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class MariaDbConnection {

    private static Connection conn = null;

    public static Connection getConnection() {
        if (conn==null) {
            // connect if necessary
            try {
                conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
                        "jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/company?user=appuser&password=password");
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                System.out.println("Connection failed.");
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            return conn;
        }
        else {
            return conn;
        }
    }

    public static void terminate() {
        try {
            getConnection().close();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

``` 

This class is a utility class for connecting to the database. The method `getConnection()` returns the connection object. The method `terminate()` closes the connection.

The `getConnection()` method ensures that only one connection is established in the lifetime of the application (in a way that resembles the singleton pattern).
The motivation for that is the fact that establishing a connection is a costly operation that takes some time. We want to avoid establishing a connection for each request.

## 7.2.4. The DAO class

The idea of the DAO (Data Access Object) class is to encapsulate the database access code. The DAO class contains the code for accessing the database. In our example, the DAO class is the `EmployeeDao` class. It looks like this:

```java
package dao;

import entity.Employee;
import java.sql.*;
import datasource.MariaDbConnection;
import java.util.*;

public class EmployeeDao {

    public List<Employee> getAllEmployees() {
        Connection conn = MariaDbConnection.getConnection();
        String sql = "SELECT first_name, last_name, email, salary FROM employee";
        List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<Employee>();

        try {
            Statement s = conn.createStatement();
            ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery(sql);

            while (rs.next()) {
                String firstName = rs.getString(1);
                String lastName = rs.getString(2);
                String email = rs.getString(3);
                double salary = rs.getDouble(4);
                Employee emp = new Employee(firstName, lastName, email, salary);
                employees.add(emp);
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        return employees;
    }


    public Employee getEmployee(int id) {
        Connection conn = MariaDbConnection.getConnection();
        String sql = "SELECT first_name, last_name, email, salary FROM employee WHERE id=?";

        String firstName = null;
        String lastName = null;
        String email = null;
        double salary = 0.0;
        int count = 0;

        try {
            PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
            ps.setInt(1, id);

            ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();

            while (rs.next()) {
                count++;
                firstName = rs.getString(1);
                lastName = rs.getString(2);
                email = rs.getString(3);
                salary = rs.getDouble(4);
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        if (count==1) {
            return new Employee(firstName, lastName, email, salary);
        }
        else {
            return null;
        }
    }

    public void persist(Employee emp) {
        Connection conn = MariaDbConnection.getConnection();
        String sql = "INSERT INTO employee (first_name, last_name, email, salary) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)";
        try {
            PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
            ps.setString(1, emp.getFirstName());
            ps.setString(2, emp.getLastName());
            ps.setString(3, emp.getEmail());
            ps.setDouble(4, emp.getSalary());

            ps.executeUpdate();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

The class contains three methods:
- `getAllEmployees()` returns a list of all employees in the database.
- `getEmployee(int id)` returns the employee with the given id.
- `persist(Employee emp)` persists the given employee in the database.

The class uses the connection object from the datasource class.

The `getAllEmployees()` method first creates a list of employees. Then it executes a query to retrieve all employees from the database.
For each employee, it creates an Employee object and adds it to the list. Finally, it returns the list.

As a `SELECT` query always returns a result set, we use a `ResultSet` object to store the result of the query. A `ResultSet` object maintains a _SQL cursor_ pointing to its current row of data. Initially, the cursor is positioned before the first row. The `next()` method moves the cursor to the next row, and because it returns false when there are no more rows in the `ResultSet` object, it can be used in a while loop to iterate through the result set. An SQL cursor is a database object used to retrieve, manipulate, and navigate through records in a result set from a SQL query. Cursors are especially useful when you need to work with one row at a time within a result set, allowing for more granular control over data manipulation. Cursor in a text editor marks the position (in a file) where modifications to the text are being done. In a similar way, cursor in SQL marks on what row (of the SQL table) the operation is being done.

For each row, the data is retrieved using the `getString()` and `getDouble()` methods.
Based on this data, an `Employee` object is created and added to the list of employees that is eventually returned.

The `getEmployee(int id)` method treats the SQL statement slightly differently.
Instead of using a `Statement` object to pass the query to the database, we use a `PreparedStatement` object.
A prepared statement is an SQL statement with a placeholder for one or more of the parameters. In this case, there is one parameter, the id.
The placeholder is represented by a question mark. The prepared statement is first created by a `Statement` object. The `Statement` object is, in turn, created
using the connection object given by the datasource class.

Before we are able to execute the prepared statement, we have to set the value of the placeholder. This is done using the `setInt()` method. The first parameter is the index of the placeholder. The second parameter is the value of the placeholder.
There are dedicated methods for different types of placeholders.
If the type of the placeholder is `String`, we use the `setString()` method. If the type of the placeholder is `double`, we use the `setDouble()` method.

The prepared statement is executed using the `executeQuery()` method. The `executeQuery()` method then returns a `ResultSet` object,
which can be iterated in a similar way as before.

This time, since we are only interested in one employee, we use a counter to check whether there is only one employee with the given id.
If there is exactly one employee with the given id, we return the employee. As the id is the primary key of the employee table,
there should never be a situation where the result set contains more than one employee. However, it is possible that there is no employee with the given id.
In this case, we return null.

The `persist(Employee emp)` method also creates a prepared statement. This time, the prepared statement is an insert statement that contains four placeholders.
As before, the placeholders are replaced by the values of the `Employee` object.
Since this is a data modification statement, we use the `executeUpdate()` method instead of the `executeQuery()` method.
The `executeUpdate()` method always returns the number of rows that were affected by the statement. In our example, the number of affected rows is always 1.

Finally, it is worth noting that in the previous example we had just one entity class that was well represented by a single DAO class.
If we had more entity classes, we might want to create a separate DAO class for each entity class. Alternatively, we could create a single DAO class that
contains methods for all entity classes.


## 7.2.5. The application class

The application class is the class that contains the main method. It looks like this:

```java
package application;

import entity.*;
import dao.*;
import java.util.*;

public class CompanyApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        EmployeeDao empdao = new EmployeeDao();

        List <Employee> employees = empdao.getAllEmployees();
        for (Employee emp : employees) {
            System.out.println(emp.getFirstName() + " " + emp.getLastName());
        }

        Employee emp = empdao.getEmployee(2);
        System.out.println(emp.getFirstName() + " " + emp.getLastName());
        
        empdao.persist(new Employee("Viivi", "Puro", "viivip@mymail.fi", 8300.00));

        datasource.MariaDbConnection.terminate();
    }
}

```

The simple application class just demonstrates the use of the `EmployeeDao` class.

The first thing we do is to create an instance of the `EmployeeDao` class. This is done using the `new` operator.
The `EmployeeDao` class has a default constructor, so we don't have to pass any parameters to the constructor.

The `getAllEmployees()` method is called and the result is stored in a list of employees. The list is then iterated and the first and last names of each employee are printed.

Next, we find the data of a single employee. The `getEmployee(int id)` method is called and the result is stored in an `Employee` object.
Then, the first and last names of the employee are printed.

Finally, we create a new employee and persist it in the database. The `EmployeeDao` class has a `persist(Employee emp)` method for this purpose.
The new employee is created using the `Employee` constructor. The constructor takes four parameters: the first name, the last name, the email and the salary.
The new employee is then passed to the `persist(Employee emp)` method.

Finally, we terminate the connection to the database. This is done using the `terminate()` method of the `MariaDbConnection` class.
The call to the `terminate()` method is not strictly necessary, but it is good practice to close the connection to the database when we are done with it.
The resources would be released anyway when the application terminates.

## 7.2.6. Error handling

In the `EmployeeDao` class, we have used a try-catch block to handle exceptions. The try-catch block is used to catch exceptions that are thrown by the code inside the try block.

As we connect to a database, various exceptions can occur. For example, the database might not be available. In this case, an exception is thrown and the application terminates.
Also, if the SQL statement is invalid, an exception is thrown.
In the code above, we only have a simple catch block that catches all exceptions. In a real application, we would have to handle the different exceptions separately.
Moreover, we should replace the `printStackTrace()` method call with a more meaningful error handling procedure.

## Assignment: A database-enhanced currency converter

In the previous assignment, you created a database for storing information about currencies. Now, you will expand your earlier currency converter application so that it uses the database.

First, redesign your project structure so that you have separate packages for:
- the user interface (the view of the application)
- the application logic (the controller of the application)
- the data access layer (the DAO classes)
- the entity classes (the classes that represent the data in the database. These are probably one-to-one to your model classes.)
- the datasource class (the class that handles the connection to the database)

You may modify the existing project, or create a new one. If you work on the existing project, consider creating a new branch for the new version.

Make your application connect to the database. For inspiration, check the `MariaDbConnection` class in the example above.

In the earlier application, your controller class is responsible for reacting to the button presses that initiate the conversion. Now, add a `CurrencyDao` class into the `dao` package in your project. The class is responsible for communicating with the database. Add a method for retrieving the exchange rate of a currency from the database, and embed the required SQL statement into the method. The method should take the abbreviation of the currency as a parameter, and return the exchange rate as a double value.
Modify your controller method so that it uses the values fetched from the database instead of the hard-coded values. (By the way, now is a good time to delete the hard-coded currencies from your code, if you have them.)

Prepare for errors. For instance, if the database is not available, your application should not crash. Instead, it should display an error message to the user. While testing, an easy way to simulate an error is to change the server name in the `MariaDbConnection` class to something that is not a valid server name.

At this point, your application should work as before, but the exchange rates are fetched from the database.

For this assignment, you get points as follows (PLEASE NOTE! You need to inform in your answer what of the following items (1–6) you have done, otherwise you will not get points for the assignment):
1. You have refactored your code to reflect the new project structure. (1 point)
2. Your application successfully connects to the database. (1 point)
3. You have created a `CurrencyDao` class that contains a method for fetching the exchange rate of a currency from the database. (1 point)
4. Your Controller class uses the aforementioned method to successfully fetch the exchange rate. (1 point)
5. Your application works as before (meaning: as described in the earlier GUI assignment), except for the fact that the exchange rates are fetched from the database. (1 point)
6. Your application displays an appropriate error message in the user interface if the database is not available. (1 point)
