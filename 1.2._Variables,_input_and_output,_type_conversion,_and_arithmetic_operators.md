# 1.2. Variables, input and output, type conversion, and arithmetic operators

In this submodule we learn how to use variables in Java. We also learn how to read input from the user and how to print output to the user, and convert variables from one type to another. We also learn how to perform arithmetic operations and use constants in Java.

## 1.2.1. Variables

Variables are used to store data in a computer program. In Java, all variables must be declared before they can be used. In declaration of a variable, its type and name are specified. For example, the following code declares a variable named `x` of type `int`:

```java
int x;
```

A variable can be assigned a value only after it has been declared. For example, the following code assigns the value `5` to the newly-declared variable `x`:

```java
int x;
x = 5;
```

The declaration and the assignment of value can be combined into a single statement:

```java
int x = 5;
```

Many variables of the same type can be declared in one statement. For example, the following code declares three variables of type `int` and assigns values 1, 2, and 3 to them, respectively:

```java
int x = 1, y = 2, z = 3;
```

In the examples above, all variables were of integer type, which is denoted by the keyword `int`. Java has a few other types, which are shown in the table below:

| Type      | Description                            | Example value   |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `int`     | integer                                | 5               |
| `double`  | double-precision floating-point number | 3.14            |
| `boolean` | boolean value                          | `true`          |
| `char`    | character                              | `'a'`           |
| `String`  | string                                 | `"Hello World"` |

Note that the `String` type is not a primitive type, but a class. We will learn more about classes later.

For string literals, the double quotes `"` must be used, and for character literals, the single quotes `'` must be used. For example, the following shows the valid use of string and character literals:

```java
String s = "Hello World";
char c = 'a';
```

In addition to the types enlisted above, there are a few other rarely used types, which we will not discuss here.
> If you are interested in those other primitive types, look [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html).

Once a variable __type__ has been declared, it cannot be changed (keep in mind that the value itself can be changed). For example, the following code is invalid:

```java
int x = 5;
x = 3.14; // invalid
```

The fact that the type of each variable has to be declared in advance is called static typing. Static typing is a feature of many programming languages, including Java. Static typing has a few advantages over dynamic typing, which is used in some other programming languages (like Python). For example, static typing allows the compiler to detect some errors in the program before the program is run. For example, the following code is invalid:

```java
int x = 5;
x = "Hello World"; // invalid
```

Also the fact that each variable must be declared in advance adds protection against typos. For example, the following code is invalid:

```java
int averageSalary = 2375;
System.out.println(averageSallary); // invalid
```

The compiler will detect the typo in the name of the variable `averageSallary` and will report an error. In a dynamically typed language, a new variable called `averageSallary` would be created, and possibly initialized to zero, and the program would run without errors, but the output would be incorrect.

The names of variables can contain letters, digits, and the underscore character `_`. The first character of a variable name must be a letter or the underscore character. Variable names are case-sensitive. For example, the following are valid variable declarations:

```java
int x;
int _x;
int x1;
int X;
int _X;
int _1;
```

> Even though the aforementioned variable names are syntactically valid, it is common to avoid underscores in the names of regular variables. Also, it is common to use camelCase in variable names, i.e., the first letter of each word in the variable name is capitalized, except for the first word. For example, the following are valid variable names that comply with the aforementioned conventions:
> 
> ```java
> int students;
> int numberOfStudents;
> int numberOfStudentsInClass;
> ```

Also, Scandinavian letters can be used in variable names as any other Unicode characters.
For example, the following are valid variable declarations:

```java
int ä = 1;
int ålder = 25;
double öljynHintaPerLitra = 1.55;
```

The use of Scandinavian letters in variable names is not recommended, however, because it makes the code less readable for people who do not speak Scandinavian languages. Also, the Scandinavian letters may display incorrectly on some computers.

## 1.2.2. Input and output, arithmetic operators

### Reading user input

Reading user input from the keyboard is not as straightforward in Java as it is in some other programming languages.

Let's start with an example that reads a name from the user and prints a greeting to the user. The code for this example is shown below:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class HelloUser {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("What is your name? ");
        String name = reader.nextLine();

        System.out.println("Hello " + name + "!");
    }
}
```

In Java, we need to use the `Scanner` class to read user input. The `Scanner` class is part of the `java.util` package, which is not included in the default Java installation. Therefore, we need to import the `Scanner` class before we can use it. Classes are imported with an `import` statement that is placed before the class declaration.

In the `main` method, the first thing to do is to create a new `Scanner` object. The `Scanner` object is created with the following statement:

```java
Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
```

The `Scanner` object is created with the `new` keyword, which we will learn more about later. The `Scanner` object is assigned to the variable `reader`, which is of type `Scanner`.

Once the `Scanner` object has been created, we can use it to read user input. The `Scanner` class has a method called `nextLine()`, which reads a line of text from the user. The `nextLine()` method is called with the following statement:

```java
String name = reader.nextLine();
```

The notation for calling a method resembles that of Python. 

The statement above not only calls the `nextLine()` method, but also assigns the return value of the method to the variable `name`. The `nextLine()` method returns a `String` object, which is assigned to the variable `name`.

If we wanted to read more input from the user, we could use the same `Scanner` object to read more input. For example, the following code reads two lines of text from the user:

```java
Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.print("What is your name? ");
String name = reader.nextLine();

System.out.print("How old are you? ");
int age = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());

System.out.println("Hello " + name + ", you are " + age + " years old!");
```

In the latter example, there is a need for a type conversion. The `nextLine()` method returns a `String` object, but the variable `age` is of type `int`. Therefore, we need to convert the `String` object returned by the `nextLine()` method to an `int` object. This is done with the `Integer.parseInt()` method, which converts a `String` object to an `int` object. 

The following table lists the most common type conversion methods that can be used to convert a `String` object to a primitive type:

| method                   | primitive type | example usage                               |
|--------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `Integer.parseInt()`     | `int`          | `int x = Integer.parseInt("123");`          |
| `Double.parseDouble()`   | `double`       | `double x = Double.parseDouble("3.14");`    |
| `Boolean.parseBoolean()` | `boolean`      | `boolean x = Boolean.parseBoolean("true");` |


> Above, we used the `Scanner.nextLine()` method to read input from the user. The `Scanner` class has also methods for directly reading various primitive types from the user. For example, the `nextInt()` method reads an `int` value from the user. This approach has the drawback that the newline character entered after, for example, an integer value is not consumed by the `nextInt()` method. In the subsequent call to the `nextLine()` method, the unconsumed newline character in the buffer is consumed, and the `nextLine()` method will return an empty `String` object without waiting for user input.
> 

In the previous examples, we have used a few Java classes in the Java standard library,
such as the `Scanner` class. The Java standard library contains a large number of classes that can be used in Java programs. The Java standard library is divided into packages, which are collections of related classes. For example, the `Scanner` class is part of the `java.util` package. The `java.util` package contains classes that are useful for reading user input, among other things.

The documentation of the Java standard library can be found at [https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/). The documentation contains a list of all the classes in the Java standard library. The documentation also contains a description of the methods of each class. For example, the documentation of the `Scanner` class can be found in the module called `java.base`. In the documentation of the module, first click on the `java.util` package. Then, click on the `Scanner` class to see the documentation of the `Scanner` class.

> In addition to the package system, Java provides a so-called module system, which is used to divide the Java standard library into modules. For that reason, you see the module name `java.base` in the documentation. While being a useful tool for managing dependencies in a complex project, the module system is not relevant to us at this point, so we will not discuss it much on this course. 

Also, the `Double`, `Integer`, and `Boolean` classes that we used in the previous examples are part of the Java standard library. Their documentation can be found in the `java.lang` package. Learning to read the API documentation of the Java standard library is an important skill for a Java programmer. When developing in Java, it is a common practice to have the API documentation open in a browser window.


### Arithmetic operators

The following table lists the arithmetic operators that can be used in Java:

| operator | operation      | example usage |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| `+`      | addition       | `1 + 1`       |
| `-`      | subtraction    | `2 - 1`       |
| `*`      | multiplication | `2 * 3`       |
| `/`      | division       | `4 / 2`       |
| `%`      | remainder      | `5 % 2`       |

The arithmetic operators can be used with both `int` and `double` values. However, if both operands are `int` values, the result of the operation is also an `int` value. For example, the result of the operation `5 / 2` is `2`, not `2.5`. If at least one of the operands is a `double` value, the result of the operation is also a `double` value. For example, the result of the operation `5.0 / 2` is `2.5`.

The following examples shows the use of artihmetic operators. It asks the user for three (possibly decimal) numbers and prints the sum, average, and product of the numbers.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SimpleCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Type the first number: ");
        double firstNumber = Double.parseDouble(reader.nextLine());

        System.out.print("Type the second number: ");
        double secondNumber = Double.parseDouble(reader.nextLine());

        System.out.print("Type the third number: ");
        double thirdNumber = Double.parseDouble(reader.nextLine());
        
        double sum = firstNumber + secondNumber + thirdNumber;
        double average = sum / 3;
        double product = firstNumber * secondNumber * thirdNumber;
        
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        System.out.println("Average: " + average);
        System.out.println("Product: " + product);
    }
}
```

Let's try the program with numbers 1.5, 8.0, and 3.4:

```text
Type the first number: 1.5
Type the second number: 8.0
Type the third number: 3.4
Sum: 12.9
Average: 4.3
Product: 40.8
```

### Increment and decrement operators

In addition to the aritmetic operators, there are increment and decrement operators that modify the value of a variable. The following table lists the increment and decrement operators:

| operator | operation      | example usage |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| `++`     | increment      | `x++`         |
| `--`     | decrement      | `x--`         |
| `+=`     | increment by   | `x += 5`      |
| `-=`     | decrement by   | `x -= 5`      |
| `*=`     | multiply by    | `x *= 5`      |
| `/=`     | divide by      | `x /= 5`      |
| `%=`     | remainder by   | `x %= 5`      |

The increment and decrement operators can be used with both `int` and `double` values. However, if the operand is an `int` value, the result of the operation is also an `int` value. For example, the result of the operation `x++` for integer `x` is `x + 1`, not `x + 1.0`. If the operand is a `double` value, the result of the operation is also a `double` value. For example, the result of the operation `x++` for a double-valued `x` is `x + 1.0`.


### Printing output to the user

Already in the first Hello World example we learnt that the output of a Java program can be sent to the console using the `System.out.println()` method. This is the most basic way of printing output to the user.

However, there are other ways of printing output to the user. For example, we can use the `System.out.print()` method to print output to the user without a new line character at the end of the output. We can also use the `System.out.printf()` method to print output to the user using a format string.

The following program asks the user for two decimal numbers. Then it computes the sum of squares of the two numbers. The original numbers and the sum of squares are then printed to the user. In the output, the numbers are formatted to have two decimal places. All numbers are right-aligned in the output.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SumOfSquares {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
        double firstNumber = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
        double secondNumber = scanner.nextDouble();

        double sumOfSquares = Math.pow(firstNumber, 2) + Math.pow(secondNumber, 2);

        System.out.println("\n");
        System.out.printf("The first number is:   %6.2f\n", firstNumber);
        System.out.printf("The second number is:  %6.2f\n", secondNumber);
        System.out.printf("The sum of squares is: %6.2f\n", sumOfSquares);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

Here is an example of the program's output:

```text
Enter first number: 1.5
Enter second number: 3.4

The first number is:    1.50
The second number is:   3.40
The sum of squares is: 13.61
``` 


The first parameter of the System.out.printf() method call is a format string. The format string can contain plain text and format specifiers. The format specifiers start with a percent sign (`%`) and are followed by a character that specifies the type of the value to be printed. The following table lists the most common format specifiers:

| format specifier | type of value to be printed |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| `%d`             | `int`                       |
| `%f`             | `double`                    |
| `%s`             | `String`                    |

The format specifiers can also contain additional parameters that specify the width and precision of the value to be printed. For example, the format specifier `%6.2f` specifies that the value to be printed is a `double` value that is right-aligned in a field that is 6 characters wide and has two decimal places. Here are some examples of format strings and their output:

| value of the variable `x` | format string | output       | description                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `123`                     | `%d`          | `123`        | `x` is printed as an `int` value.                                                                                                                         |
| `123`                     | `%6d`         | `   123`     | `x` is printed as an `int` value that is right-aligned in a field that is 6 characters wide.                                                              |
| `123`                     | `%06d`        | `000123`     | `x` is printed as an `int` value that is right-aligned in a field that is 6 characters wide. The field is padded with zeros.                              |
| `123.456`                 | `%f`          | `123.456000` | `x` is printed as a `double` value.                                                                                                                       |
| `123.456`                 | `%6.2f`       | `123.46`     | `x` is printed as a `double` value that is right-aligned in a field that is 6 characters wide and has two decimal places.                                 |
| `123.456`                 | `%08.2f`      | `00123.46`   | `x` is printed as a `double` value that is right-aligned in a field that is 8 characters wide and has two decimal places. The field is padded with zeros. |
| `12345678`                | `%.2e`        | `1.23e+07`   | `x` is printed as a `double` value in scientific notation with two decimal places.                                                                        |

At this point, you probably notice the resemblance between the format strings for the `System.out.printf` method and the Python f-strings.

## 1.2.3. Mathematical functions

In the previous example, the sum of squares of two numbers was computed using the `Math.pow()` method. The `Math.pow()` method computes the value of the first parameter raised to the power of the second parameter. The `Math.pow()` method takes two `double` values as parameters and returns a `double` value.

It is an example of a built-in mathematical function. In Java, mathematical functions are provided by the `Math` class. The `Math` class is part of the `java.lang` package, which is automatically imported to all Java programs. That means, they can be used without an explicit import statement.

The `Math` class provides a large number of mathematical functions. The following table lists some of the most common mathematical functions:

| method name | description                    | example of use    | result of the example of use |
|-------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| `abs(x)`    | absolute value                 | `Math.abs(-5)`    | `5`                          |
| `ceil(x)`   | ceiling                        | `Math.ceil(5.1)`  | `6.0`                        |
| `floor(x)`  | floor                          | `Math.floor(5.9)` | `5.0`                        |
| `max(x, y)` | maximum                        | `Math.max(5, 9)`  | `9`                          |
| `min(x, y)` | minimum                        | `Math.min(5, 9)`  | `5`                          |
| `pow(x, y)` | `x` raised to the power of `y` | `Math.pow(2, 3)`  | `8.0`                        |
| `round(x)`  | round to the nearest integer   | `Math.round(5.1)` | `5`                          |
| `sqrt(x)`   | square root                    | `Math.sqrt(9)`    | `3.0`                        |


The `Math` class also provides the following two constants:

| constant name | description      | value               |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| `Math.PI`     | the value of π   | `3.141592653589793` |
| `Math.E`      | the value of *e* | `2.718281828459045` |

Whenever you need to refer to either of these constants, you can use the `Math.PI` or `Math.E` expression.

> The mathematical functions and constants are in the `Math` class which is a part of the `java.lang` package. That package, in turn, belongs to the Java API. The Java API is a library of classes that are an inherent part of the Java platform. You can assume that all classes belonging to the Java API are available in any Java environment.

> It is important to learn to read the documentation of the Java API. The documentation of the Java API is available online at [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/17/docs/api/](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/17/docs/api/). Can you find the documentation of the `Math` class in the Java API? Can you find the documentation of the `Math.pow()` method from there?

 
 
## 1.2.4. Type conversion

In the earlier examples we learnt to convert the input strings to various elementary data types. For example, we converted the input string to an `int` value using the `Integer.parseInt()` method. We also converted the input string to a `double` value using the `Double.parseDouble()` method.

In Java, we can convert a value of one type to another type using a cast. A cast is an operation that converts a value of one type to another type. The syntax of a cast is as follows:

```java
(type) value
```

Here, `type` is the type to which the value is cast. The value can be any expression that evaluates to a value of the type `type`. For example, the following code reads an integer value from the user, converts it to a `double` value, divides it by two, and prints the result:

```java
public class DivideByTwo  {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
        int intValue = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

        double doubleValue = (double)intValue / 2;

        System.out.println("The result is " + doubleValue);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

In the example, the value of the variable `intValue` is cast to a `double` value using the cast `(double)intValue`. The casted value is then divided by two and assigned as the value of the variable `doubleValue`.

Let's consider what will happen if we omitted the typecast in the example. In that case, the value of the variable `intValue` would be divided by two and the result would be assigned as the value of the variable `doubleValue`.

However, the result of the division would be an `int` value. This is because the division operator `/` performs an integer division if both operands are `int` values. The integer division means that the remainder of the division is discarded. For example, the result of the division `5 / 2` would be `2`. Now that the remainder is lost, the truncated integer result of the division will be assigned to a double variable. In other words, the value of the variable `doubleValue` would be `2.0`, as the output below demonstrates:

```text
Enter an integer: 5
The result is 2.0
```
Errors like this can be avoided by type conversion.

## 1.2.5. Constants

In the previous subsections, we learnt the use of variables. The very idea of a variable implies that the value of the variable can change during the execution of the program. However, sometimes we need to use a value that should stay in the same fixed value throughout the execution. Such a value is called a constant.

In Java, a constant is defined using the `final` keyword that is placed right before the type of the variable. For example, the following code defines a constant named `CONVERSION_FACTOR` that has the value `0.45359237`:

```java
final double CONVERSION_FACTOR = 0.45359237;
```

As you see, the name of the constant, `CONVERSION_FACTOR`, is written in uppercase letters, and the words are separated by underscores. This is a common convention in Java programs that is aimed at making the constants stand out from the other variables. 

The value of a constant must be set only once. That can be done at the time of the definition of the constant or later in the program. The following program asks the conversion factor from the user, and then sets the value of the constant `CONVERSION_FACTOR` to the value entered:

```java
public class Constant {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the conversion factor: ");
        final double CONVERSION_FACTOR = Double.parseDouble(scanner.nextLine());

        /* program code */
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

The usage of the constant guarantees that the value of the variable `CONVERSION_FACTOR` never changes during the execution of the program. The ultimate reason for using constants is that they make the program easier to read and understand, and protect the programmer from making mistakes.

If we tried to assign a new value to a constant in the program, the compiler would give us an error message.



## Assignments

**Task 1: Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter**

Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature in Fahrenheit and converts it to Celsius. Display the converted temperature on the console with one decimal place.

**Task 2; Triangles**

Write a program that asks the user for the lengths of the legs of a right triangle and prints the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle.

**Task 3: Obsolete measures**

Leiviskä, naula and luoti are medieval Finnish units of measurement.
- One leiviskä is 20 naula.
- One naula is 32 luoti.
- One luoti is 13.28 grams.

Write a program that asks the user for a weight in grams and converts it to medieval measurements: leiviskä, naula, and luoti. The program should work in the following way:
```text
Weight (g): 30000
30000 grams is 3 leiviskä, 10 naula, and 19.04 luoti.
```

That is, leiviskä and naula are printed as integers, and luoti is printed with two decimal places.
