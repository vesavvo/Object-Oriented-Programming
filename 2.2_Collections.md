# Collections

It would be nice to be able to handle a bunch of car objects together as a collection—insert new cars easily into the collection, remove cars from the collection, no need to decide on the maximum number of cars etc.

*Collections* (sometimes called *containers*) are holders that let you store and organize objects in useful ways for efficient access. What will be efficient depends on how you need to use the collection, so collections come in many flavors. Most programming environments provide some collection types, ranging from impoverished up through gargantuan.
> The idea behind collections is [generic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming) programming, i.e., making software components that are reusable. The first collections library (it was called as [Standard Template Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library)) was introduced for the C++ programming language in the year 1993 by [Alexander Stepanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stepanov). It was a high success, and was copied to other programming languages rapidly. Java Collection Framework was introduced in the year 1998.

Java API has a rich set of [collection](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/intro/index.html) classes that allow for more dynamic behavior, and provide additional functionality.

Collection framework has classes that behave like:
- **lists** - when _sequence_ matters. Collections that know about ***index position***. Lists know where something is in the list. You can have more than one element referencing the same object.
- **sets** - when _uniqueness_ matters. Collections that ***do not allow duplicates.***
- and **maps** (technically maps are not collections, but we often use them in collection contexts) — when ***finding something by key matters***. Collections that use *key-value pairs.* Maps know the value associated with a given key. You can have two keys that reference the same value, but you cannot have duplicate keys. Although keys are typically `String` names (so that you can make name/value property lists, for example), a key can be any object.

## (Array)List - when sequence matters

[ArrayList](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) is an example of a list or sequence (and also array), it is a collection. There is no need to decide on collection size at creation time (as it is with arrays). ArrayList size can grow automatically when new elements are added to the list.

`ArrayList` behaves like an array, i.e., elements are accessible by index:
- `add(i, e)` - adds e into position i
- `set(i, e)` - replaces element at position i with e
- `get(i)` - returns element at position i
- (and more)

In computer science, a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)) refers to a data structure that stores a collection of elements in a specific order, and duplicates are allowed. A list is a fundamental concept and is used extensively in various programming languages and algorithms. Lists are a form of linear data structure, which means that the elements are ordered sequentially, one after the other. Java `Arraylist` behaves also like a list:
- `add(e)` - adds to an end of ArrayList
- `isEmpty()`, `size()`, `contains(o)`, `remove(o)`
- (and more)

`ArrayList` class is declared like this:
```Java
public class ArrayList<E> extends AbstractList<E> implements List<E>, RandomAccess, Cloneable, Serializable
```
\<E\> is a [type](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/types.html) parameter—it is instantiated when an ArrayList instance is created. This whole system is called as [generics](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/why.html). Java Generics is a feature
to enhance the type safety and reusability of code. Generics allow developers to write classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with different types while providing compile-time type checking.

With generics, you can create classes and methods that are parameterized with type variables. These type variables represent unknown types and can be replaced with actual types when the code is used or instantiated. This enables you to create reusable components that can handle different data types without sacrificing type safety.

The primary benefits of using Java Generics are:

1. Type safety: Generics ensure that the code is type-safe at compile time. The compiler can detect and prevent type-related errors, such as incompatible type assignments or method invocations.
2. Code reuse: By using generics, you can create generic classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with multiple types. This promotes code reuse and reduces code duplication.
3. Stronger compile-time checks: With generics, you can specify constraints and bounds on type parameters. This allows the compiler to perform stronger type checks and enforce restrictions on the usage of generic types.

To define a generic class or interface, you use angle brackets (<>) and a type parameter. For example:
```Java
ArrayList<Person> persons = new ArrayList<>();
```
Now we have variable `persons` which refer to an `ArrayList` whose elements are of class `Person`. Note that the Java compiler can deduct the type of the `ArrayList` from the left side of the assignment operator, therefore the type on the right side of the assignment can be left empty, i.e., `<>`.

It is (of course) possible to iterate through an `ArrayList` by using indexing:
```Java
for (int i = 0; i < persons.size(); i++)
    System.out.print(persons.get(i));
```
But we also have a much handier enhanced `for`-loop:
```Java
for (Person person : persons)
    System.out.println(person);
```
This enhanced version works with arrays, too. Inside this enhanced `for`-loop it is not allowed to modify the container content (adding or removing elements).

Let's have an example where we don't know at the compilation time a how large array we will need to store information. In this example application, we don't know how many names the user will enter to the system. Therefore, we need to use `ArrayList` collection class where the container can enlarge itself automatically when needed (instead of an ordinary Java array).
```Java
public class PersonTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String firstname;
        int age;
        ArrayList<Person> persons = new ArrayList<>();
        
        do {
            System.out.print("Give firstname: ");
            firstname = scanner.nextLine();
            if (firstname.length() > 0) {
                System.out.print("Give age: ");
                age = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());
                persons.add(new Person(firstname, age));
            }
        } while (firstname.length() > 0);
        
        System.out.println("Added " + persons.size() + " persons.");
        System.out.print("Give the index of the person searched for 0.." + (persons.size()-1) +": ");
        System.out.println(persons.get(scanner.nextInt()));

        // Add one additional Person at the beginning of the list
        persons.add(0, new Person("Vilhelm", 90));
        
        System.out.println("All persons:");
        for (Person person : persons)
            System.out.println(person); // calls Person.toString()
    }
}
```

## (Hash)Map - when finding something by key matters

Java [HashMap](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html) is a class that implements the [Map interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html) (we will talk interfaces later) and provides an efficient way to store and retrieve _key-value pairs_. In these pairs, each element is associated with a unique key that is used to retrieve the corresponding value. The HashMap uses the hash code (an integer in Java) of the key to determine the bucket (index) where the key-value pair will be stored, check [this](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/hash-tables/basics-of-hash-tables/tutorial/) for more information. Hash code function, `hashCode()`, for the Java String is calculated by evaluating the following equation _hashCode = s[0]*31<sup>(n-1)</sup> + s[1]*31<sup>(n-2)</sup> + ... + s[n-1]_
where _s[0]_ is the first element of string _s_, _s[1]_ is the second element and so on. _n_ is the length of the string. Therefore `hashCode()` function returns different value for different strings with very high probability. There is a good [tutorial](https://samwho.dev/hashing/) on hash codes.
```Java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = "Java";
        String str2 = "Java Programming";
        String str3 = "";
    
        System.out.println(str1.hashCode()); // 2301506
        System.out.println(str2.hashCode()); // 1377009627
    
        // hash code of empty string is 0
        System.out.println(str3.hashCode()); // 0
    }
}
```

An element is retrieved using a key from the `HashMap`. Because `HashMap` is implemented using generics
```Java
public class HashMap<K,V> extends AbstractMap<K,V> implements Map<K,V>, Cloneable, Serializable
```
The key `K` can be a general type. The only requirement is that it should have the `hashCode()` function.

Notice the difference between `Array(List)` and `HashMap`. Arrays use an integer index to retrieve elements; `HashMap` uses an object (e.g., `String`, `Person`, etc.) to retrieve elements from the container. This kind of retrieving is called as an associative search.

HashMap is often used through `Map` interface, it has the following functions:
- `put(k, e)` - adds e with a key k to the HashMap
- `get(k)` - retrieves an element with a key value k, returns null if not found
- `containsKey(k)` - returns true when an element with key value k is found, false otherwise
- `remove(k)` - removes an element with a key value k
- `size()` - returns the number of elements in the `HashMap`
- (and more)

Iterating over all elements in the HashMap is possible using the enhanced for-loop
```Java
    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : scores.entrySet()) {
        // statements for handling one key/value pair (an entry)
    }
```    
 
Map interface method `entrySet()` returns a [set](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/java-tutorial/set-in-java), which has `Map.Entry` interface entries (key/value pairs). These key and value values can be obtained using `getKey()` and `getValue()` methods of the entry.   

```Java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a HashMap
        Map<String, Integer> scores = new HashMap<>();

        // Add key-value pairs
        scores.put("Alice", 90);
        scores.put("Bob", 85);
        scores.put("Charlie", 95);

        // Retrieve values
        int aliceScore = scores.get("Alice");
        System.out.println("Alice's score: " + aliceScore);

        // Check if a key exists
        boolean hasCharlie = scores.containsKey("Charlie");
        System.out.println("Does Charlie exist? " + hasCharlie);

        // Iterate over the key-value pairs
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : scores.entrySet()) {
            String name = entry.getKey();
            int score = entry.getValue();
            System.out.println(name + "'s score: " + score);
        }

        // Remove a key-value pair
        scores.remove("Bob");
    }
}
```

## (Tree)Set - when uniqueness matters 

[TreeSet](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html) is a class in the Java Standard Library that implements the [Set](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html) interface. It is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to store a collection of elements in a sorted order. Specifically, a `TreeSet` maintains its elements in a [red-black tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree) data structure, which ensures that the elements are stored in a sorted order and allows for efficient operations like insertion, deletion, and searching.
`TreeSet` maintains its elements in a sorted (ascending) order. This sorting is based on the natural order of the elements (defined by their `compareTo` method) or a custom comparator that you can provide when creating the `TreeSet`.
`TreeSet` does not allow duplicate elements. Each element in a `TreeSet` must be unique.
`TreeSet` provides methods that allow you to navigate through the sorted set of elements, such as finding the next or previous element in the natural order.

> `TreeSet` is only one possible implementation of the `Set` interface. There are other implementation options in Java: `HashSet`, `EnumSet` and `LinkedHashSet`. Each of them has a few different properties, e.g., `HashSet` is fast, but does not preserve order. In the course, "Data Structures and Algorithms" we'll talk about those properties, where they are good and where not.

Here's a simple example of using a `TreeSet`:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TreeSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a TreeSet of integers
        TreeSet<Integer> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();

        // Adding elements
        treeSet.add(5);
        treeSet.add(2);
        treeSet.add(8);
        treeSet.add(1);

        // Printing the sorted elements
        for (int num : treeSet) {
            System.out.println(num);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the elements `1`, `2`, `5`, and `8` are automatically sorted in ascending order when added to the `TreeSet`.

For collections without a specific order, you can explore implementations of the more general `Set` interface, such as `HashSet`. If you need to handle duplicated elements, you should use other collections than implementations of `Set`, e.g., ArrayList, which implements List interface. For the following code:
```Java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.TreeSet;

public class SetDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a TreeSet of Strings
        TreeSet<String> treeSetStr = new TreeSet<>();

        // Adding elements
        treeSetStr.add("Volvo");
        treeSetStr.add("BMW");
        treeSetStr.add("Ford");
        treeSetStr.add("BMW");
        treeSetStr.add("Mazda");

        // Printing the sorted elements
        System.out.println("Sorted Set: " + treeSetStr);
        for (String car : treeSetStr) {
            System.out.println(car);
        }

        // Creating a HashSet of Strings
        HashSet<String> hashSetStr = new HashSet<>();

        // Adding elements
        hashSetStr.add("Volvo");
        hashSetStr.add("BMW");
        hashSetStr.add("Ford");
        hashSetStr.add("BMW");
        hashSetStr.add("Mazda");

        // Printing unsorted elements
        System.out.println("Unsorted Set: " + hashSetStr);
        for (String car : hashSetStr) {
            System.out.println(car);
        }
    }
}
```

The output will be:
```text
Sorted Set: [BMW, Ford, Mazda, Volvo]
BMW
Ford
Mazda
Volvo
Unsorted Set: [Volvo, Mazda, Ford, BMW]
Volvo
Mazda
Ford
BMW
```
It can be seen that the `TreeSet` sorts the elements automatically, while the `HashSet` does not guarantee any specific order. Notice that the duplicate element `BMW` is not added to the `TreeSet` second time, as `Set` does not allow duplicates.

On some occasions you can benefit the uniqueness requirement of the `Set`. If you have a collection, and you want to count how many different values you have in a collection, it is possible to convert the given collection to `Set` and then check what is size of the resultant `Set`. 
```Java
// Map container holds the count how many times (Integer) a given word (String) exists in a given text
Map<String, Integer> word_counters = new HashMap();
        .
        .
        .
// here we do the counting, like: word_counters.put(word, word_counters.get(word) + 1);
        .
        .
        .
// check now how many different values we have in the word counters
System.out.println("We have " + new HashSet<Integer>(word_counters.values()).size() + " different values");
```
At the last line of the previous code block, we extract all the values of the `HashMap` using `values` method. These values are given to `HashSet` who removes duplicates. All we need to do then is to check how many elements we have on that `Set` using `size`method.

## Summary

| Feature        | ArrayList           | HashMap                 | TreeSet                |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Interface**  | `List`              | `Map`                   | `Set`                  |
| **Structure**  | Dynamic array       | Hash table              | Red-Black tree         |
| **Ordering**   | Insertion order     | No guaranteed order     | Sorted order           |
| **Duplicates** | Allowed             | Keys: No, Values: Yes   | Not allowed            |
| **Access Time** | `O(1)` (index)     | `O(1)` (hash lookup)    | `O(log n)` (tree lookup) |
| **Insertion/Deletion** | `O(n)` (middle) | `O(1)` (average) | `O(log n)` |
| **Use Case**   | Ordered collection with fast random access | Fast key-based lookup | Sorted, unique collection |

> Those O(1), O(log n) and O(n) are so called big-O notations. We'll talk about the [Big-O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) in the course "Data Structures and Algorithms". It is a way to describe the performance of an algorithm in terms of how it responds to changes in input size. O(1) means that the algorithm's performance is constant, regardless of the input size. O(log n) means that the algorithm's performance grows logarithmically with the input size. O(n) means that the algorithm's performance grows linearly with the input size. O(1) is the fastest, O(n) ia slower and O(log n) is slower than O(1) but faster than O(n). [Big-O notation visualization](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)

- **Use `ArrayList`** when you need an ordered list and fast random access.
- **Use `HashMap`** when you need fast lookups using keys (key-value pairs).
- **Use `TreeSet`** when you need a **sorted** set with **unique** elements.

Each of these collections serves a different purpose, so choosing the right one depends on the requirements of your application.


## Assignments

**Task 1: Grocery List Manager**

#### Exercise Description:
In this exercise, you will create a Java program that simulates a simple grocery list manager using `ArrayList`. The program will allow users to perform various operations on a grocery list, such as adding items, removing items, displaying the list, and checking if a specific item is present.

#### Instructions:
1. Create a Java class named `GroceryListManager`.
2. Inside the `GroceryListManager` class, declare an `ArrayList` to store the grocery items. Use the following code to create the ArrayList:
   ```java
   import java.util.ArrayList;

   public class GroceryListManager {
       private ArrayList<String> groceryList = new ArrayList<>();

       // Add methods here
   }
   ```
3. Implement the following methods inside the `GroceryListManager` class:
    - `addItem(String item)`: This method should add the given item to the grocery list.
    - `removeItem(String item)`: This method should remove the given item from the grocery list.
    - `displayList()`: This method should display all the items in the grocery list.
    - `checkItem(String item)`: This method should check if the given item is present in the grocery list and return a boolean value.

4. Create a `main` method in the `GroceryListManager` class to demonstrate the functionality of the methods you implemented. In the `main` method, perform the following actions:
    - Add a few items to the grocery list.
    - Display the grocery list.
    - Check if a specific item is present in the grocery list.
    - Remove an item from the grocery list.
    - Display the updated grocery list.

#### Example Output:
```text
Grocery List:
1. Apples
2. Milk
3. Bread

Is "Milk" in the grocery list? true

Removing "Milk" from the list...

Updated Grocery List:
1. Apples
2. Bread
```

Note: You are encouraged to enhance the exercise by adding error handling to handle cases such as adding duplicate items, removing non-existent items, and so on.

**Task 2: Total Cost Calculation**

Modify the `GroceryListManager` class to store both the item name and its corresponding cost as a pair (e.g., using a `HashMap<String, Double>`). Add the following methods:

- `addItem(String item, double cost)`: This method should add the given item and its cost to the grocery list.
- `calculateTotalCost()`: This method should calculate and return the total cost of all items in the grocery list.

**Task 3: Categorizing Items**

Enhance the `GroceryListManager` class to support categorizing items. Each item should belong to a category (e.g., "Fruits", "Dairy", "Bakery"). Add the following methods:

- `addItem(String item, double cost, String category)`: This method should add the given item to the grocery list along with its category.
- `displayByCategory(String category)`: This method should display all items in the specified category.

**Task 4: Quantity Tracking**

Extend the `GroceryListManager` class to track the quantity of each item in the list. Add the following methods:

- `addItem(String item, double cost, String category, int quantity)`: This method should add the given item along with its quantity to the grocery list.
- `updateQuantity(String item, int newQuantity)`: This method should update the quantity of the specified item in the grocery list.
- `displayAvailableItems()`: This method should display items along with their quantities that have a positive quantity.

**Task 5: Grocery List tester**

Add new functionalities to the `GroceryListManager` class to test those new features, total cost, categories of items and quantity tracking. Total cost calculation should be tested by adding items with different costs and displaying the total cost (you should also take care of the quantity when calculating the total cost). Categories of items should be tested by adding items to different categories and displaying items of a specific category. Quantity tracking should be tested by adding items with different quantities and updating the quantity of an item.

For this assignment, you get points in the following way:
1. Task 1 completed: 2 points
2. Task 2 completed: 1 point
3. Task 3 completed: 1 point
4. Task 4 completed: 1 point
5. Task 5 completed: 1 point
